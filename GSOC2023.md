# Overview
As it stands currently, using C++ from Swift is work in progress and reverse interop is also a goal for the interoperability between Swift and C++. Reading the manifesto for interoperability itself and understanding the goals itself is a great learning and exciting experience. Having gone through the experimental ability to interoperate with C++ and the getting started with C++ interoperability it is clear that we already have good support for C++ language features and for std::string and std::vector. Swift to C++ interoperability supports String, Array<T> and Optional<T>.
# To-Do Features for using C++ from Swift
### C++ STL
The C++ STL is quiet rich and used extensively. The iteroperability will provide access to a host of libraries which are already available in C++. We could consider providing support for the containers incrementally for std::pair, std::list, std::queue, std::deque and others. The reference for std::vector is a good starting point for additional contaners and its functions to be supported.
### C++ Language Features
There are some gaps mentioned in the interoperability status like exceptions and virtual member functions which can be considered more important than the others. 

# Testing and Performance
Testing for current features supported and for performance would be the approach I would consider to learning so that I can contribute to the plans as recommended by the mentors. 

# Other areas to consider
The reverse interoperability is also an area where we could take an approach of increasing more features to be supported in-line with the plans going forward based on the Forward Vision document.
